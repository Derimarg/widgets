You should know how to write semantic HTML tags, how to write CSS selectors, how to use classes, how to implement a CSS reset, box model, how to reset to border-box, flexbox, how to write responsive web applications including media queries, and how to build a frontend application using HTML and CSS.

    title: "Fundamentals of Javascript and ES6",
    text: `No matter what… you can’t get better at React if your javascript fundamental is not clear. During the interviews, it is one of the essential skills to learn before moving to react. Javascript is one of the most confusing languages for developers and it ignores small errors that can create a problem in your project if you won’t notice it earlier. So make sure that you first clear your basic concept about javascript and then you move to the advanced version of ECMAScript5 and ECMAScript6. Some of the topics are given below but make sure that you explore as much as you can and build some projects as well for in-depth knowledge in javascript. 
    Remember that building the basic foundation of javascript will help you to learn any framework but if the concept won’t be clear you will get stuck in any javascript framework. Also, the interviewer will check your fundamentals in javascript first before moving to the React.
     
    
    Start with variables, numbers, boolean, string,s and make your concepts clear about other very basic fundamentals. Make some small app on that like a calculator to see how things work together.
    Learn about operators, conditionals, functions, loops, javascript keywords, array, objects, and other fundamentals.
    Event handling, DOM manipulation, and how ‘this’ keyword works totally different in javascript (which is confusing for most of the developers).
    Higher-order function, callback function, arrow function, state (how state and setState() function works) scope, class & constructors, extends and inheritance, map, reduce, filter, promises, modules, closures, const, let (difference between var, let and const) and other features of ES5 and ES6.`,
